## Thank you for reading. Now let's talk about the real stuff.
### This mod adds:
- A a structure, it has a low chance to spawn.
- Ban Hammers(Which are the swords FYI). They do a lot of damage the more better you craft.
- Mobs. This is not a joke, I'm being serious.
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- A Katana and a Battle Axe.
- **~~T H E M~~** *Ahem* Sorry about that, I meant to say Sharkos.

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I only made this so you amazing people can see what the old version looked like before this year.
